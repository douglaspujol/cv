## **Summary**

Hello! I am a software engineer with nearly 6 years of experience, specializing in front-end and full-stack development. I develop web and mobile solutions, always aiming to create scalable applications that provide exceptional user experiences. Throughout my professional journey, I have had the privilege of contributing to various projects, working with large companies and startups across Latin America.

Currently, I work as a Tech Lead at Orbia, a company in the agribusiness sector, where I develop a global marketplace for the agricultural industry. I have solid expertise in technologies like ReactJS, React Native, Expo, Typescript and Node. I dedicate my time to studying system design, micro front-ends, BFF (Backend for Frontend), Golang, as well as other related fields.

Passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex challenges, I focus on building solutions that make a real difference in users’ lives. Eager to learn, I’m always exploring new approaches and excited to work on projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible.
